> **Previously**, I worked with GLG for nearly a year. Me and my team got to work on one particular project at scale, where I lead the migration to a new & improved service we created, saving $1M/yr in infrastructure costs.
>
> **Now**, I am working at OwlLabs, I have Product responsibilities to determine the SaaS offerings our customers need to support their teams and our devices. I am also the sole Engineer building the Product. If all goes well, \*fingers crossed\* we will be growing the team and I will have a management role.
>
> I am very excited for a high-growth role, and put my full-self into such a big problem like a brand new product.
