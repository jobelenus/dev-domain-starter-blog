## **Now, as of Apr 1, 2021**

I've been at OwlLabs for over a year and a half. I'm leading the Cloud team as a Principal Engineer and we're working on brand new products that are going to be shipping in the next few months. We are growing like a weed with no sense that it will slow down any time soon.

It is an exciting time, with few moments to take a breath. I revel in the challenge of leading a team that is integrating with a larger Engineering department. I have areas of technical growth ahead of me, but I am honestly more interested in growing as a leader in an organization.
