There are tons of opinions and ideas on how to get software engineers to work together, and I’ve shared some of my own before. I think the crucial one to get right is coming to the idea of a Directly Responsible Individual. Whether it is a bug, a feature, a service, part of a product, or the whole product (for smaller products) there should be **one DRI**.

I believe this the most effective, and most natural way to do our work. I believe this is, more or less, how open source projects tend to work. Single individuals own features, parts of the project, bug fixes, and processes. And decisions flow through those individuals.

## How It Works

It is very simple. The DRI is the source of truth for that indivisible thing. And “indivisible” is how you decide how many DRI’s you need to have. The DRI is where the buck stops. They are fundamentally responsible for what they are given to work on. For a sports example; the coach is the DRI of the team, when the team fails to perform the coach gets fired. Why? Because there was zero question who was responsible for the on-field performance of the team.

The DRI gets the final say. You can imagine this as if they have a 51% voting majority on every part of their project. Ownership in the strict sense of the word. They should, of course, ask for input, feedback, and opinions from others on their team and others not on their team. The individual knows their piece is but one piece of the greater whole, and everyone is working towards reaching the final goal. But the decisions ultimately rests with them. Why? Because the responsibility of delivery rests with them. You cannot give them full responsibility without full autonomy, otherwise you’re sabotaging them from the start.

## How It Can Work For You

The list of responsibilities you give to the DRI is up to you. If TDD is important to you, make it their responsibility too. If you want them to fully document their project, from goals to decisions to user training, go ahead. If you don’t have a dedicated DevOps team you can make it the DRI’s responsibility to manage the project in production. Of course, if you have a DevOps, or a product team responsible for documentation, or a QA team, etc, those teams ought to have their own responsibilities. Make the lines crystal clear.

Whether everyone works on their own, is paired up, or a mix of the two there should still be a single DRI. If you’re pairing, give them each a related thing to own. And they can switch during the day as to whose project they are working on, who is making the final decision.

Whether you have teams of three, or teams of eight, or twenty, you should be able to chop up the work into indivisible pieces. Naturally, there will be pieces that have to work closely together; two different pieces sharing the same data store and data models, many pieces using one API service, etc. But so long as you have defined and documented interfaces, you can surface discussions around a ChangeLog when things need to change.

## Why It Works

I believe this works because owning what you’re working on gets you invested in doing a good job. It’s yours, no one else’s. Since it doesn’t belong to anyone else, it will reflect you and your choices.

There can be no buck-passing; “Oh, I thought someone else was going to do that,” and there can be no wondering about why something didn’t get done. There can be no disagreement as to how something ought to work, because one person makes that decision. The only question becomes: is it performing?

## How It Fixes Management

This makes management’s job much clearer; _**they now have one job and that job is to set context.**_ Your manager, or lead, doesn’t have to wondering whether or not they should “jump in” and help you out. You can ask them. When you feel they are deciding things for you, you get to say: Thank you for your input, I will make the decision. Both micromanagement and drive-by-management need to be shut down, because it is no longer their job to make decisions. Their job is to set the context.

Management needs to give you the reasons why we’re doing this work. They need to give you the end goal, the job your software needs to do. They need to tell you what you’re starting with, and where you’re headed. They don’t get to decide the path you’re going to take.
