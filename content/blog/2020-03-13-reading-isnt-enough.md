This is a trap that I fall into. I like reading, I've got a list of books I want to read. I learn from reading. But Engineer, even Software Engineering, is something you only *really* learn by doing.

You can read all the documentation. You can read an entire codebase. And you will understand a good portion of it. But you won't really know it, how it works, or it's limitations.

I often start new projects or features by trying to read as much as I can. I try to find a path through the jungle and see the end before I start. Depending on what the work is that can be quick...or not.

Sometimes I don't get my hands dirty early enough, in a classic turn of phrase from Joel Spolsky, to launch the damn editor. Because this is a field where you learn by doing, not by reading.
