Almost two years ago I wrote an entry here titled *[Engineering in the Time of Product Market Fit](https://blog.jobelenus.dev/blog/engineering-in-the-time-of-product-market-fit/)*. I talked a lot about doing "just enough" to get by, to ship, to get feedback, and to find what people will buy. The premise of the piece is that you're in a specific phase of life as a business.

I am naturally inclined, by my career experiences & personal views, to optimize for Time To Value. For me, it holds true regardless of the phase you're in. We are always trying to reduce the time to value. That is the name of the game we are playing.

What changes are the constraints. Sometimes there are very few constraints, like a startup that doesn't have PMF yet. Other times the main constraint is: "do everything you can to ensure nothing explodes" e.g. risk to the business is the failure mode, if your company has been an industry leader for a dozen years already and the way to keep winning is simply not to shoot yourself in the foot. The startup doesn't care if it shoots itself in the foot, barely anyone knows they exist yet. Fire away!

**What Is The Time To Value?** Would be my #1 engineering culture value, if I was the person tasked with defining those sorts of things for a group of humans. Ask that question multiple times a day as you're working. Then ask how to make it shorter. Put that phrase on a sticky note at the bottom of your monitor, so you always have it in front of your face.

Time is the one thing we can't get back. So we better figure out how to get feedback as fast as possible. To get valuable feedback you have to deliver value to users. This is why everyone is chasing after CI/CD. It *allows* you to reduce the time to value. You still have to take advantage of it by shipping constantly.

I think this is why the OODA loop speaks to me so strongly. The "Observe" element is about seeing what ripples your previous action just hadâ€”did it deliver value? No, re-orient and try again. Yes, re-orient and continue with more, or move to a different value to deliver.

I try to avoid adopting military metaphors for Engineering work for many reasons. How can I adapt jet fighter combat thinking? Well, the "value" Boyd was searching for was the ability to dump or generate energy to change the velocity of an aircraft. He sought to accomplish that both technically in the design or the aircraft itself, and in the training of the pilots. After all, if the machine has a limit but the humans can't push themselves to use it all, what are you left with? The OODA loop was his training tool to get his group of humans to think faster than their enemy. If the aircraft can dump energy and generate energy quicker than the enemy, and the pilot can observe, orient, decide, and act in quicker cycles than the enemy they have the tactical advantage.

Now, in software engineering we don't really have enemies, and unless you're working on the power & heat management of a datacenter we're not fighting against physics and the laws of nature either.

We're not fighting, which is why I try to avoid military metaphors. But we still need to shorten our OODA loop, and the "value" we are searching for is "solving our users problems." It is practically a tautology given this framing that value delivered sooner is better than value delivered later. Its the same theory as the time-value of money: a dollar this week is more valuable than two dollars next week.

I am guessing that most people just don't know *how* to lower it? They would if they could. But they don't know how to push beyond where they are.
